<title> How to live a healthier life style!</title>
<body style="background-color:powderblue;"> 
<h1> What is the first step to living a healthier lifestyle?</h1> 
<p> The first step is simple, you need to figure out what your long term and short term goals are. for example a short term goal could be to cut out sugar and carbs, and lose 10 pounds in the span of one month. A long term goal could be to workout at least 3 times a week and to lose 70 pounds in one year. it is important to know that living a healthy lifestyle doesn't mean you can eat, or do things that you enjoy, everything is okay in moderation if you wake up one morning craving something sweet, have something sweet, but only have one as opposed to five. if the next morning you wake up craving something sweet, instead of giving in, try a berry smoothie, which are both healthy, and sweet!</p>
